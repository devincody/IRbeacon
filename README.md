Who likes remotes anyways?

I certainly don't. After being frustrated with having to find the remote for the TV or the oscillating fan or our roomba knock-off, I've decided to just let google home manage them for me.

Dependancies:
flask
pyserial



## Hardware
I designed the PCBs using CircuitMaker, leveraging the work that I already put into the temperature probe hat I developed previously.
